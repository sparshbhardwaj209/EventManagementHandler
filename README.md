Welcome to the **Event Management Platform**! This full-stack web application allows users to create, view, and manage events with real-time updates. With robust user authentication (including guest login), real-time attendee tracking via Socket.IO, and Cloudinary image integration, this project is designed to provide an intuitive experience for both organizers and attendees.
